# Tips when installing Rails with Postgres on Macbook M1 natively

## Tip 1 - Make sure your terminal is NOT using Rosetta

Type: `brew config`

Make sure, you're running the terminal with Rosetta 2 set to `false`. Same goes for the homebrew install.

## Tip 2 - use native packages through the whole chain

For each software package or tool, that you install make sure you install their native ARM versions. brew will usually manage that for you. I use `rbenv` to manage my ruby versions. For example, if you are using ruby on the M1, always prefer the native version.

`ruby -v` outputs:
`ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [arm64-darwin20]`

So, clearly, we are using the arm64 for this installation of ruby


If you do not have the native ARM version of Ruby 2.7.4, you may see something like:

`ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [x86_64-darwin20]` (Notice the "x86_64")

Then, you may uninstall that Ruby version using `rbenv uninstall 2.7.4` and install ruby again using `rbenv install 2.7.4` (Just keep tip 1 in mind when you do so).

Make sure that rbenv's Ruby version is global by using `rbenv global`. You may then open a new terminal window and check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`.

## Tip 3 - Install libpq

From the libpq doc: "libpq is the C application programmer's interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a set of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results of these queries".

`brew install libpq`

This is required when trying to use Postgres connectors in any app.

Also, make sure it is available on PATH by running:

`export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"`

## Tip 4 - Check for existing versions of Postgresql

If you're installing Postgresql through brew.

`brew services list | grep postgres`

should give you the current versions of postgresql currently installed on your mac. Make sure you use the version 13.

Version 14 at the time of writing is not officially compatible with MacOS 11.

`brew install postgres@13`

Start the server

`brew services start postgresql`



Sometimes, the command `brew services start postgresql` may throw an error. You may then try to restart the server with `brew services restart postgresql`. 

(Alternatively, you can also restart the server by `brew services stop postgresql` followed by `brew services start postgresql`)

Finally, you may check if everything is ok using `psql -d postgres`. If all is well, you would see something like: 

```
psql (14.0, server 13.4) 
Type "help" for help.
postgres=# 
```

### If the server is not starting

If you have installed through homebrew, the log files location of postgres can be found in
`/opt/homebrew/var/log/`

Open the `postgres.log` or `postgres@13.log` for hints of what went wrong

## Tip 5 - Install the required packages

Install rails and pg

```
gem install rails
gem install pg
```

## Tip 6 - Errors related to Lock Files

If you have this error: "Could not open lock file "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock"

Possible Reasons:

- A server crash may have kept this file in a locked state.
- The user who has started the pg agent doesn't have permission to delete the lock file
- Postgres is not able to write a file to /tmp directory because of permission issues
- Another user has tried to open postgres on the same port

Solutions:

- Stop the service, delete ONLY the lockfile(.s.PGSQL.5432.lock) from /tmp directory and start that service again. If you the same error happens, please try reboot your mac
